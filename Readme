By using federated queries in Amazon Redshift, you can query and analyze data across operational databases, data warehouses, 
and data lakes. 
With the Federated Query feature, you can integrate queries from Amazon Redshift on live data in external databases 
with queries across your Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3 environments. 
Federated queries can work with external databases in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, Amazon RDS for MySQL, and Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition.


  Why Use Federated Queries?
- Real-Time Access: Enables querying of live data from external sources without the need for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
